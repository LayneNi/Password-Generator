# Password-Generator

## Description

    The motivation behind this challenge was to learn how to use functions, for loops and arrays to create a working application through JavaScript. I built this project to generate passwords randomly utilizing functions like Math.random and alters/ prompts to interact with a web page. This application solves the problem of having to come up with a password by giving you a very secure password. I learned a ton about functions and for loops in this challenge as well as many different functions like the .concat function and .join and JavaScript in general.
